# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images

Developed a deep learning model to detect Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images using the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset. Preprocessed data by normalizing and resizing images. Trained a CNN using Keras and evaluated it with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. Optimized the model with data augmentation and transfer learning, and developed a web application for detecting Pneumonia from new Chest X-ray images.

## Features
- Image normalization and resizing
- CNN training using Keras
- Model evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, and Recall
- Data augmentation and transfer learning
- Web application for pneumonia detection
